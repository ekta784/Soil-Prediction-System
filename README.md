Developed a soil quality classification model using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), improving accuracy from 97.91% to 98.72% by adding an additional hidden layer and optimizing the activation function. The project includes a web interface where users can input required parameters, view graphical representations of soil quality, and receive nutrient recommendations for healthy crop growth.
